# Space
## A privacy first multi-platform filesystem.
### usespace.io

Space is storage and file sharing re-imagined. Build a map of every file, on every computer, hard-drive, cloud and SD card you ownâ€”and search it in one place. Organize, share, transcode and track redundancy; Space empowers total control over the ever growing collection of data you own. Its entirely private, with industry standard 256-AES client-side encryption protecting your every move, never sharing your files or knowledge of your files with anyone.

Space also features peer-to-peer file sharing. Your contacts can request to send a file, you can accept from an inbox of pending files and the sender can cancel the request at anytime. Both clients being online are required, though a transfer request will begin automatically upon the clients going online. 

Create Spaces... 

Time travel to any day to see the files you created on that day, across all storage locations.
